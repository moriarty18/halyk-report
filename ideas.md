<idea>
  **Design Movement**: Corporate Modernism meets Fintech Cleanliness
  **Core Principles**: Clarity, Trust, Data-First, Professionalism
  **Color Philosophy**: Halyk Green (#007A55) as the primary anchor, supported by deep charcoal (#1F2937) for text and soft gray (#F3F4F6) for backgrounds. The green symbolizes growth and stability, while the clean white space emphasizes transparency.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Single-page scrolling report with sticky navigation. Section-based layout with clear visual separation using alternating background colors (white / light gray).
  **Signature Elements**: 
    - Card-based metrics with subtle drop shadows
    - Clean, flat data visualizations (charts, funnels)
    - Rounded corners (radius-md) for a modern but professional feel
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Smooth scrolling between sections. Hover effects on metric cards to encourage focus. Simple, non-distracting transitions.
  **Animation**: Fade-in elements on scroll. Counter animations for key numbers (e.g., "2,575 Leads").
  **Typography System**: 
    - Headings: 'Inter' or system sans-serif, Bold/ExtraBold for impact.
    - Body: 'Inter' or system sans-serif, Regular for readability.
    - Monospace for data values if needed, but primarily sans-serif for a clean look.

  **Design Movement**: Swiss Style / International Typographic Style
  **Core Principles**: Grid systems, Asymmetry, Sans-serif typography, Objective photography
  **Color Philosophy**: High contrast black and white with Halyk Green as a strict accent color. Very little use of gray backgrounds, relying on white space and strong grid alignment.
  **Layout Paradigm**: Modular grid. Content is aligned strictly to a 12-column grid. Asymmetric placement of images and text blocks to create dynamic tension.
  **Signature Elements**: 
    - Large, bold typography for section headers
    - Thick horizontal rules (lines) to separate content
    - Images treated as geometric blocks
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Snappy, instant transitions. No "smooth" easing, just precise state changes.
  **Animation**: Minimal. perhaps simple slide-ins from the grid lines.
  **Typography System**: 
    - Headings: Helvetica or similar neo-grotesque, tight tracking.
    - Body: Helvetica, high readability.

    - Frosted glass effect (backdrop-filter: blur)
    - Vivid, glowing gradients in the background
    - Thin, semi-transparent borders
  **Interaction Philosophy**: Fluid, floating feel. Parallax effects on scroll.
  **Animation**: Continuous slow movement of background elements. Soft glow effects on hover.
